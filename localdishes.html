        <h1>Vakfıkebir Ekmeği:</h1> <big>This bread, produced in Vakfıkebir and Beşikdüzü, as well as in Maçka – Hamsiköy, ranges from 450 gr to 7.5 kilos in weight. 
        It is known nearly everywhere in Turkey as “Vakfıkebir” or “Trabzon” bread. In addition to Trabson, it is especially produced in small towns along major highways.
         It is baked in a wood-fired stone oven, and is leavened with natural sourdough. Vakfıkebir bread is flavorful, has a long shelf life, and does not mold easily. 
        When it goes stale it is still good. During recent years, companies producing Vakfıkebir bread have opened in large cities such as Istanbul and Ankara. 
        As it’s cooked in stone ovens, it is also known as “Stone oven” (Taşfırın) bread. In some areas it is mistakenly called “wood bread” (odun ekmeği); what is meant is that the oven is wood-fired. A “Vakfıkebir Bread Festival” is held each year for the purpose of promoting this bread domestically and abroad.

        <p><h1>Pide (butter, egg, cheese, ground meat, sucuk):</h1> <big>These are the pides well-known today as “Trabzon pidesi.” 
            The one known as yağlı pide is generously topped with butter before baking. 
            The yumurtalı (egg) pide is the same with the addition of an egg,
             which is generally broken onto the dough and spread without much mixing.
             Peynirli pide is topped with a local cheese called “kolof cheese,” 
            which resembles young kashar or mozzarella. 
            (The name “kolof” here refers to a type of bread which this cheese outwardly resembles.) 
            Ground meat and sucuk pides are less common. In Trabzon, as well as large cities such as Istanbul and Ankara, there are bakeries that produce this pide exclusively.

        <p><h1>Telli Peynir (String Cheese):</h1><big>Finished kolof cheese is put into boiling water and sprinkled with a little salt. 
            After boiling for a time, it is removed from the hot water, and when it has cooled, it kneaded and pulled out into strings.
             These are hung on nails to dry, and cut into 5-15 cm lengths. It is then mixed with salted minci (yogurt cheese) and packed into tins. 
            This is fresh string cheese, and it is eaten for breakfast. 
            The tins were once sealed and buried in the ground, which allowed the cheese to be stored for long periods. 
            As the cream was partially removed from the milk when the kolof cheese was made, it is not a full-fat cheese.
